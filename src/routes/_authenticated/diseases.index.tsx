            Every disease area brings a different eligibility problem. Cardiovascular studies rest on
            routine measurements, oncology on subtype and prior treatment, stroke on timing, rare
            disease on very small populations. Each page shows live registry trials for that area and
            how protocol criteria become structured, checkable screening logic.
