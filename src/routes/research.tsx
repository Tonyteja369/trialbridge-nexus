            ClinQSphereX does not claim quantum advantage. Quantum performance is experimentally
            evaluated against classical baselines on identical data, and results are reported
            whatever they show. Where an experiment has not been run, the interface says so instead
            of displaying a number.

            The platform provides screening support. It does not determine clinical eligibility,
            diagnosis, treatment or enrolment; a qualified researcher makes every decision.
